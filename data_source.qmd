## Data Quality and Limitations

### Strengths
✓ **Comprehensive temporal coverage**: 45 years of NBA team statistics (1980-2025)
✓ **Official sources**: Basketball Reference (trusted), Yahoo Finance (authoritative)
✓ **Multiple financial instruments**: 5 stocks provide robust sports betting/entertainment sector coverage
✓ **Fully documented**: All extraction methods and sources provided for replication

### Limitations
⚠ **Manual data collection for NBA stats**: Basketball Reference lacks API, requires manual download
  - *Mitigation*: Documented step-by-step process ensures replicability

⚠ **Team-level aggregation only**: No individual player tracking
  - *Mitigation*: Team-level appropriate for league-wide structural change study

⚠ **Sports betting stocks limited to 2020+**: Market didn't exist before 2018
  - *Mitigation*: 2020-2025 captures COVID disruption and market maturation phases

⚠ **Annual frequency for NBA data**: Limits some time series techniques
  - *Mitigation*: 45 observations sufficient for ARIMA; financial data provides high-frequency component

## Replication Instructions

To fully replicate this data collection:

### 1. Basketball Reference Data (Team Advanced Stats)

**Manual Download** (required due to lack of API):

```bash
# For each season from 1980-81 to 2024-25:
# 1. Navigate to: https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_[YEAR].html
# 2. Scroll to "Advanced Stats" table
# 3. Click "Share & Export" → "Get table as CSV (for Excel)"
# 4. Save the file to data/adv_stats/[YEAR]_adv_stats.csv
# 5. Repeat for all 45 seasons
```

**Read CSV files in R:**
```r
library(tidyverse)

# Read all advanced stats files
all_adv_files <- list.files("data/adv_stats", pattern = "*.csv", full.names = TRUE)

# Combine all seasons
all_adv_data <- map_df(all_adv_files, function(file) {
    season_str <- str_extract(basename(file), "\\d{4}-\\d{2}")
    season_year <- as.numeric(str_sub(season_str, 1, 4)) + 1

    df <- read_csv(file, show_col_types = FALSE)
    df$Season <- season_year
    return(df)
})

# Calculate league averages
league_avg <- all_adv_data %>%
    group_by(Season) %>%
    summarise(
        ORtg = mean(`Unnamed: 10_level_0_ORtg`, na.rm = TRUE),
        DRtg = mean(`Unnamed: 11_level_0_DRtg`, na.rm = TRUE),
        Pace = mean(`Unnamed: 13_level_0_Pace`, na.rm = TRUE),
        `3PAr` = mean(`Unnamed: 15_level_0_3PAr`, na.rm = TRUE),
        `TS%` = mean(`Unnamed: 16_level_0_TS%`, na.rm = TRUE),
        .groups = "drop"
    )
```

### 2. Financial Data (Yahoo Finance)

**Step 1: Install yfinance**
```bash
pip install yfinance pandas numpy
```

This script (`download_financial_data.py`) automatically:
- Downloads all 5 stocks (DKNG, PENN, MGM, CZR, DIS)
- Calculates returns, log returns, and volatility metrics
- Saves CSV files to `data/financial/`
- Prints summary statistics

**Step 3: Read in R**
```r
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

# Read DKNG data
dkng <- read_csv("data/financial/DKNG_daily.csv") %>%
    mutate(Date = ymd(Date))

# Convert to weekly for SARIMA (seasonality = 52)
dkng_weekly <- dkng %>%
    mutate(Week = floor_date(Date, "week")) %>%
    group_by(Week) %>%
    summarise(
        Adj_Close = last(`Adj Close`),
        Weekly_Return = (last(`Adj Close`) - first(Open)) / first(Open),
        .groups = "drop"
    )

# Create time series object
ts_dkng_weekly <- ts(dkng_weekly$Weekly_Return, frequency = 52)
```
