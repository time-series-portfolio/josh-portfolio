    "text": "What is a Time Series?\nA time series is any sequence of measurements taken at regular, equally spaced intervals—seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, quarters, or years. Common examples include weather (daily temperature or rainfall), financial markets (daily stock prices or returns), industry indicators (monthly production or sales), electricity demand, traffic counts, and hospital admissions. In time-series analysis we study how these values evolve: their level, trend, seasonal or calendar patterns (e.g., weekdays vs. weekends, holiday effects), cycles, and anomalies. Typical goals are to describe behavior clearly, forecast future values, and quantify the impact of events or policies.\nBecause observations are ordered in time, nearby points tend to be correlated (autocorrelation). This violates the independent-and-identically-distributed assumption behind many standard statistical methods, so naïve cross-sectional tools often mislead. Time-series work must explicitly handle dependence, trend, and seasonality—for example by differencing, seasonal adjustment, and models that usen lagged values and errors (e.g., ARIMA/SARIMA, ARIMAX/SARIMAX with external drivers, VAR for multiple series, state-space/ETS, or GARCH when volatility changes over time). Analysts also watch for structural breaks (e.g., policy shifts, COVID), outliers, and missing periods, and they evaluate models with time-aware validation (rolling or blocked splits) rather than random shuffles."

    "text": "This portfolio explores Sports Betting Market Dynamics and Expected Value Persistence through comprehensive time series analysis. The project investigates how betting odds, line movements, and market inefficiencies evolve over time across professional sports leagues, with particular attention to the temporal aspects of opportunity detection and market corrections. By analyzing real-time odds data, fair value calculations, and expected value opportunities from SportsRadar feeds, this study examines the patterns that drive profitable betting strategies and market efficiency.\nThe analysis focuses on understanding how information flows through betting markets, identifying periods of market inefficiency, and quantifying the predictive power of various market indicators. This research applies sophisticated time series models (ARIMA, GARCH, VAR, Interrupted Time Series) to decode the complex temporal dynamics of prediction markets, including the critical role of latency in opportunity capture and portfolio performance.",

    "text": "Sports betting has rapidly expanded into a multi-billion-dollar global industry, serving not only as entertainment but also as a live laboratory for prediction markets. Unlike traditional financial markets, sports betting markets have defined endpoints (game outcomes) and rapidly incorporate new information from diverse sources such as player injuries, weather, and public sentiment. Because of this unique structure, sports betting markets provide an excellent lens for studying market efficiency, volatility, and temporal information flow.\nRecent growth in real-time data providers such as SportsRadar makes it possible to measure odds movements, expected value (EV) opportunities, and settlement times with millisecond precision. This creates a natural opportunity to examine latency—the time lag between when information becomes available, when markets adjust, and when bettors (or automated systems) can capture profitable opportunities.\nUnderstanding these temporal dynamics matters not only for sports bettors but also for financial market analytics, as the patterns and inefficiencies observed in betting markets often mirror those found in equities, options, and other fast-moving financial instruments.",
