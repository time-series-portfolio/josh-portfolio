Hi, my name is Josh Lin and I'm from New York. I'm a second year in the DSAN program at Georgetown University. I studied mathematics at New York University for my undergrad. I am super excited to start my career in data science especially coming from a math background - finally being able to apply the theory I've learned to solve/alleviate real-world data problems. In my free time I enjoy listening to music, playing video games, and hanging out with the homies.
